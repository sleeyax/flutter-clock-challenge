# sleeyax_clock

[Flutter clock challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock) submission.

## Features
- temperature indicator (red = hot, blue = cold, orange = in between)
- weather animations
- show time, weather, location on screen

## Showcase ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4twX7txWLI))
The temperature indicator moves aroud the clock to indicate the seconds that passed. In a real world scenario the user would tap the clock to stop the indicator from moving. This feature is not implemented because adding gestures isn't allowed according to the competition rules.
